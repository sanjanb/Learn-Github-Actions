# Repository Setup for GitHub Actions

Welcome to the guide on setting up your repository for GitHub Actions! This document will walk you through the essential steps to configure your repository for using GitHub Actions, enabling you to automate your CI/CD workflows efficiently.

## Introduction to Repository Setup

Repository setup is the foundational step for using GitHub Actions. It involves creating a specific directory structure and configuring workflow files that define how GitHub Actions should operate within your repository.

## Core Directory Structure

To get started with GitHub Actions, you need to create a specific folder structure in your repository:

1. **Create the `.github/workflows` Directory:**
   - At the root of your repository, create a directory named `.github`.
   - Inside the `.github` directory, create another directory named `workflows`.

## Placement of Workflow Files

The `.github/workflows` directory is where you will place your GitHub Actions configuration files. These files are written in YAML format and define the workflows for your CI/CD pipelines.

### Key Points:

- **Multiple Workflow Files:** You can have as many workflow files as needed in the `.github/workflows` directory. Each file can serve a different purpose, such as building your project, running tests, deploying applications, or checking code quality.
- **Example Workflow Files:**
  - `ci-build.yaml`: For continuous integration builds.
  - `pr-title-check.yaml`: For verifying pull request titles.
  - `release.yaml`: For deployment workflows.
  - `sync.yaml`: For synchronization tasks.

## Triggering Actions

Workflow files specify when and how actions should be triggered. This is done using the `on` keyword, which defines the events that initiate the workflow.

### Example Events:

- `push`: Triggers the workflow on every commit.
- `pull_request`: Triggers the workflow on pull requests.
- `issues`: Triggers the workflow on issue creation or updates.

GitHub automatically monitors the repository for these events and executes the corresponding workflows when the specified events occur.

## Workflow File Structure (YAML)

Each workflow file follows a specific YAML structure:

```yaml
name: Example Workflow

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
```

### Key Components:

- **`name`:** A descriptive name for the workflow.
- **`on`:** The events that trigger the workflow.
- **`jobs`:** Defines the jobs to be executed. Each job runs in a specified environment (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
- **`steps`:** The individual commands or actions within a job. Steps can use pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace or run custom commands.

## Using Pre-built Actions/Plugins

GitHub Actions allows you to use pre-built actions or plugins from the GitHub Marketplace, reducing the amount of code you need to write. These actions are auto-installed and ready to use.

### Examples:

- `actions/checkout@v3`: Checks out your repository's code.
- `actions/setup-python@v2`: Sets up a Python environment.
- `actions/setup-java@v3`: Sets up a Java environment.

## Repository-Level Configuration

Beyond workflow files, you can configure additional settings at the repository level:

- **Self-Hosted Runners:** If the default GitHub-provided runners do not meet your needs, you can configure self-hosted runners in the repository settings for better control over compute resources and security.
- **Secrets Management:** Store sensitive information such as API tokens, database passwords, and configuration files securely in the repository settings. These secrets can be referenced in your workflow files without exposing sensitive data.

## Conclusion

Setting up your repository for GitHub Actions involves creating the `.github/workflows` directory and configuring YAML workflow files. These files, along with repository-level settings for runners and secrets, enable you to automate your CI/CD workflows efficiently. With a simple and intuitive setup process, GitHub Actions makes it easy to integrate continuous integration and deployment into your development workflow.

Happy coding!
