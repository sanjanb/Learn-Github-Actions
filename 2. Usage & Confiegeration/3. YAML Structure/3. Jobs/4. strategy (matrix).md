# Using Strategy (Matrix) in GitHub Actions

Welcome to the guide on using the strategy (matrix) feature in GitHub Actions! This document will explain how to configure your GitHub Actions workflows to run jobs across multiple environments or dependencies using a matrix strategy. Although the term "matrix" is not explicitly used in the sources, the functionality described aligns with this concept.

## Introduction to Strategy (Matrix)

In GitHub Actions, a matrix strategy allows you to run a job across multiple configurations, such as different operating systems, environments, or dependency versions. This is particularly useful for testing your code in various setups using a single, concise YAML definition.

## Setting Up the Workflow Directory

Before diving into the matrix strategy, ensure you have the required directory structure in your repository:

1. **Create the `.github/workflows` Directory:**
   - At the root of your repository, create a directory named `.github`.
   - Inside the `.github` directory, create another directory named `workflows`.

## Configuring a Matrix Strategy

While the sources do not explicitly use the term "matrix," they describe a functionality that aligns with it. You can configure a job to run multiple times, each with a different setup, by specifying multiple versions or environments.

### Example:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
```

### Key Points:

- **Matrix Definition:** The `strategy` keyword with the `matrix` option allows you to define multiple configurations for a job. In this example, the job will run twice, once for Python 3.8 and once for Python 3.9.
- **Dynamic Values:** Use the `${{ matrix.python-version }}` syntax to dynamically set the Python version for each job run.
- **Flexibility:** This approach provides flexibility in testing your code across different environments or dependency versions, ensuring compatibility and robustness.
- **Efficient Testing:** By running the job against multiple configurations, you can efficiently test and validate your code in various setups.

## Benefits of Using a Matrix Strategy

The matrix strategy offers several benefits:

- **Comprehensive Testing:** Ensure your code works across different environments, operating systems, or dependency versions.
- **Efficient Configuration:** Define multiple test scenarios in a single, concise YAML file.
- **Automated Validation:** Automatically run tests across various configurations, catching issues early in the development process.

## Conclusion

The matrix strategy in GitHub Actions allows you to run jobs across multiple configurations, providing a powerful way to test your code in various setups. By configuring a matrix strategy, you can ensure your code is robust and compatible with different environments, enhancing the reliability of your automated workflows.
