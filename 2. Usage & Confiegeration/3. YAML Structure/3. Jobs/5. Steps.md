# Creating Steps in GitHub Actions

Welcome to the guide on creating steps in GitHub Actions! This document will explain the `steps` keyword within the YAML structure of your GitHub Actions workflows. The `steps` keyword is where you define the sequence of actions or tasks that a job will execute, forming the operational core of your workflow.

## Introduction to Steps

In GitHub Actions, the `steps` keyword is a fundamental element within the definition of a `job`. It specifies the sequence of tasks that the job will perform. This is similar to defining stages in a Jenkins pipeline, providing a structured way to organize your workflow.

## Setting Up the Workflow Directory

Before diving into the `steps` keyword, ensure you have the required directory structure in your repository:

1. **Create the `.github/workflows` Directory:**
   - At the root of your repository, create a directory named `.github`.
   - Inside the `.github` directory, create another directory named `workflows`.

## Defining Steps in a Job

The `steps` keyword is used to define the sequence of actions or tasks that a job will execute. Each step represents an individual task or operation, allowing you to organize complex workflows into logical stages.

### Example:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest

    - name: Build project
      run: mvn package

    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      run: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Key Points:

- **Sequence of Tasks:** The `steps` keyword lists the sequence of tasks that the job will execute. Each step represents an individual action or operation.
- **Pre-built Actions:** Many steps involve using pre-built actions or plugins from the GitHub Actions Marketplace. These actions simplify common tasks, such as checking out code or setting up environments.
- **Correlation with Jenkins:** The `steps` in GitHub Actions can be correlated with stages in Jenkins. You can segregate your workflow into multiple steps, such as `build`, `test`, `sast`, `dast`, and `deploy`.
- **Environment Setup:** Before defining steps, you typically set up the execution environment using the `runs-on` keyword and any necessary setup actions.

## Common Steps

Here are some common steps you might define in a GitHub Actions workflow:

- **Checkout Code:** Use the `actions/checkout@v3` action to check out your repository's code.
- **Set Up Environments:** Use actions like `actions/setup-python@v2` to set up specific environments, such as Python or Java.
- **Install Dependencies:** Run commands to install dependencies, such as `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Run Tests:** Execute test commands, such as `pytest` or `mvn test`.
- **Build Projects:** Run build commands, such as `mvn package` or `npm build`.
- **Deploy Applications:** Interact with deployment platforms, such as Kubernetes, using commands like `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.

## Conclusion

The `steps` keyword is the operational core of a job in GitHub Actions. It defines the sequence of actions or tasks that the job will execute, allowing you to organize complex workflows into logical stages. By using pre-built actions and defining clear steps, you can create efficient and modular workflows, similar to stages in a Jenkins pipeline.
