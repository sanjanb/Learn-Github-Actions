   - Save the secret.

## Use Cases for Secrets Management

Here are some examples of how you can use secrets in GitHub Actions:

- **Kubernetes Deployment:** Store your `kubeconfig` file securely to authenticate and deploy applications to Kubernetes.
- **SonarQube Analysis:** Store your SonarQube token to run code quality analysis securely.
- **API Keys and Tokens:** Store any API keys or tokens required for interacting with external services.
- **Configuration Files:** Store sensitive configuration files that should not be exposed publicly.

## Benefits of Native Secrets Management

Using GitHub Actions' native support for storing secrets offers several benefits:

- **Enhanced Security:** Avoid exposing sensitive information in your workflow files or version control.
- **Easy Access:** Secrets can be easily accessed during workflow execution without being exposed.
- **Centralized Management:** Manage all your secrets in one place, ensuring consistency and control.
