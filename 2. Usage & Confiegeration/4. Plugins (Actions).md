# Using Plugins (Actions) in GitHub Actions

Welcome to the guide on using plugins (actions) in GitHub Actions! This document will explain how to leverage pre-built actions from the GitHub Actions Marketplace to streamline your workflow configuration. These actions are fundamental components used within the `steps` of a `job`, allowing you to automate tasks efficiently.

## Introduction to Plugins (Actions)

In GitHub Actions, plugins or actions are reusable, modular components that perform specific tasks within your workflow. They are referenced within the `steps` section of a job, enabling you to automate common tasks without writing complex scripts.

## Setting Up the Workflow Directory

Before diving into using actions, ensure you have the required directory structure in your repository:

1. **Create the `.github/workflows` Directory:**
   - At the root of your repository, create a directory named `.github`.
   - Inside the `.github` directory, create another directory named `workflows`.

## Using Pre-built Actions

Within your workflow YAML files, you define jobs that contain a sequence of `steps`. Many of these steps utilize pre-built actions from the GitHub Actions Marketplace. These actions simplify common tasks, such as checking out code, setting up environments, and running tests.

### Example:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest

    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '11'

    - name: Run Maven build
      run: mvn package

    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      uses: some-kubernetes-action@v1
      with:
        kubeconfig: ${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}
```

### Key Points:

- **Auto-Installed Plugins:** Unlike Jenkins, where you manually install plugins, GitHub Actions plugins are auto-installed. You simply reference the desired action and its version in your YAML file.
- **Version Notation:** The `@vX` notation (e.g., `@v3`, `@v2`) refers to the version of the plugin, not the version of the programming language or tool it sets up.
- **Reduced Code:** Using pre-built actions reduces the amount of code you need to write, as the basic configuration is similar across different application types (Python, Java, Node, Ruby).
- **Limited Scope:** While actions streamline many tasks, they may be limited in scope compared to more established CI/CD tools like Jenkins.

## Common Actions

Here are some common actions you might use in your GitHub Actions workflows:

- **Checkout Code:** `actions/checkout@v3` checks out your repository's code.
- **Set Up Environments:** `actions/setup-python@v2` sets up a Python environment, and `actions/setup-java@v3` sets up a Java environment.
- **Run Commands:** Execute commands to install dependencies, run tests, or build projects.
- **Deploy Applications:** Use actions to interact with deployment platforms, such as Kubernetes.
- **Code Quality Analysis:** Integrate actions for tools like Sonar for code quality analysis.

## Advantages of Using Actions

Using pre-built actions offers several advantages:

- **Efficiency:** Streamline your workflow configuration by using modular, reusable actions.
- **Consistency:** Achieve consistent environments and setups across different workflows.
- **Simplicity:** Reduce the complexity of your workflow configuration by leveraging pre-built actions for common tasks.

## Conclusion

Pre-built actions in GitHub Actions are powerful tools for streamlining your workflow configuration. By using these modular, reusable components, you can automate common tasks efficiently, reducing the amount of code you need to write and ensuring consistency across your CI/CD pipelines.
