# Addressing Security and Compute Needs with Self-Hosted Runners

Welcome to the guide on addressing security and compute needs with self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions! This document will explain why and how to configure self-hosted runners when the default runners provided by GitHub do not meet your requirements for compute resources or security.

## Introduction to Self-Hosted Runners

Self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions allow you to use your own infrastructure to run workflow jobs. This is particularly useful when the default runners provided by GitHub are insufficient for your needs, whether due to limited compute resources or security concerns.

## When to Use Self-Hosted Runners

You should consider using self-hosted runners if you are not satisfied with the default runners provided by GitHub. Here are the key reasons for this dissatisfaction:

### 1. **Insufficient Compute Resources**

- **Lightweight Nature:** The default runners may be "light in nature," meaning they have limited hardware capabilities.
- **Demanding Tasks:** Tasks such as load testing require significant compute resources, which the default runners may not provide.
- **Complex Builds:** If your workflows involve complex builds or resource-intensive operations, the default runners might struggle to perform efficiently.

### 2. **Security Concerns**

- **Sensitive Data:** If you have security concerns about running your jobs on GitHub's default infrastructure, self-hosted runners allow you to execute jobs in an environment you control.
- **Compliance Requirements:** Ensure compliance with internal security policies by running jobs on your own servers.

## Configuring Self-Hosted Runners

To configure self-hosted runners, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the "Settings" tab.

2. **Access the Actions Section:**
   - In the settings sidebar, click on "Actions" to access the GitHub Actions settings.

3. **Add a New Self-Hosted Runner:**
   - Within the Actions settings, find and click on the option to add a "New self-hosted runner."
   - Follow the instructions to set up your self-hosted runner on your own infrastructure.

## Benefits of Self-Hosted Runners

Using self-hosted runners offers several benefits:

- **Performance:** Ensure that your jobs have the necessary compute resources to execute efficiently.
- **Security:** Address security concerns by running jobs in a controlled environment.
- **Flexibility:** Customize the execution environment to meet your specific needs, such as installing specific software or configuring hardware settings.

## Comparison to Jenkins Worker Nodes

Self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions serve a similar function to Jenkins worker nodes. They provide a user-managed execution environment when the default options are insufficient. This comparison highlights the flexibility and control that self-hosted runners offer, allowing you to tailor the environment to your specific requirements.

## Conclusion

When the default runners provided by GitHub are insufficient for your workflow requirements, configuring self-hosted runners is a necessary option. Self-hosted runners allow you to leverage your own infrastructure, providing the performance, security, and customization needed to execute your jobs effectively.

For more information on setting up self-hosted runners, you can refer to the [official GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).
