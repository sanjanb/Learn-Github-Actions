# Configuring Custom Runners in GitHub Actions

Welcome to the guide on configuring custom runners in GitHub Actions! This document will explain how to set up self-hosted runners within your GitHub repository, providing an alternative to the default runners offered by GitHub. This configuration allows you to tailor the execution environment to meet specific needs regarding compute power or security.

## Introduction to Custom Runners

In GitHub Actions, configuring custom runners involves setting up self-hosted runners that you manage. This process gives you the flexibility to run your jobs on infrastructure that meets your specific requirements, similar to configuring worker nodes in Jenkins.

## Setting Up Custom Runners

To configure custom runners, follow these steps within your GitHub repository settings:

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the "Settings" tab.

2. **Access the Actions Section:**
   - In the settings sidebar, click on "Actions" to access the GitHub Actions settings.

3. **Add a New Self-Hosted Runner:**
   - Within the Actions settings, find and click on the option to add a "New self-hosted runner."
   - Follow the instructions to set up your self-hosted runner. This process will involve downloading and running the GitHub Actions runner software on your own infrastructure.

## Reasons to Use Custom Runners

You might choose to configure custom runners for several reasons:

- **Compute Resources:** The default runners provided by GitHub may not have sufficient compute resources for certain tasks, such as load testing or complex builds.
- **Security Concerns:** You might have security concerns about using the default runners and prefer to run your jobs on infrastructure that you control.
- **Customization:** Self-hosted runners allow you to customize the execution environment to meet specific needs, such as installing specific software or configuring hardware settings.

## Benefits of Custom Runners

Configuring custom runners offers several benefits:

- **Tailored Environment:** Run your jobs on infrastructure that is tailored to your specific needs, ensuring that you have the necessary compute resources and security settings.
- **Flexibility:** Gain the ability to execute jobs on your self-hosted runners, providing flexibility in how you manage your CI/CD workflows.
- **Control:** Have full control over the execution environment, allowing you to address security concerns and customize the setup as needed.

## Conclusion

Configuring custom runners in GitHub Actions allows you to run your jobs on infrastructure that you manage, providing flexibility and control over the execution environment. By setting up self-hosted runners, you can tailor the environment to meet specific needs regarding compute power or security, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of your CI/CD workflows.

For more information on setting up self-hosted runners, you can refer to the [official GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).
