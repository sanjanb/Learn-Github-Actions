# When Default Runners Are Inefficient

Welcome to the guide on understanding when to use self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions! This document will explain the scenarios where the default runners provided by GitHub may not meet your needs, and why you might consider configuring self-hosted runners instead.

## Understanding Default Runners

GitHub Actions provides default runners to execute your workflows. These runners are pre-configured environments, such as `ubuntu-latest`, that are designed to handle a variety of tasks. However, there are situations where these default runners may not be sufficient for your needs.

## When to Use Self-Hosted Runners

You should consider using self-hosted runners when the default runners provided by GitHub are insufficient for your workflow requirements. Here are some key reasons why you might opt for self-hosted runners:

### 1. **Insufficient Compute Resources**

- **Lightweight Nature:** The default runners may be "light in nature," meaning they might not have the necessary compute resources for demanding tasks.
- **Load Testing:** Tasks such as load testing require significant compute resources, which the default runners may not provide.
- **Complex Builds:** If your workflows involve complex builds or resource-intensive operations, the default runners might struggle to perform efficiently.

### 2. **Security Concerns**

- **Sensitive Data:** If you have security concerns about running your jobs on GitHub's default infrastructure, self-hosted runners allow you to execute jobs in an environment you control.
- **Compliance Requirements:** Ensure compliance with internal security policies by running jobs on your own servers.

### 3. **Customization Needs**

- **Specific Software:** You might need to install specific software or configure the environment in a way that the default runners do not support.
- **Consistent Environments:** Create environments that match your production setup, ensuring that your tests and builds are more reliable.

## Configuring Self-Hosted Runners

To configure self-hosted runners, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the "Settings" tab.

2. **Access the Actions Section:**
   - In the settings sidebar, click on "Actions" to access the GitHub Actions settings.

3. **Add a New Self-Hosted Runner:**
   - Within the Actions settings, find and click on the option to add a "New self-hosted runner."
   - Follow the instructions to set up your self-hosted runner on your own infrastructure.

## Benefits of Self-Hosted Runners

Using self-hosted runners offers several benefits:

- **Performance:** Ensure that your jobs have the necessary compute resources to execute efficiently.
- **Security:** Address security concerns by running jobs in a controlled environment.
- **Flexibility:** Customize the execution environment to meet your specific needs.

## Conclusion

When the default runners provided by GitHub are insufficient for your workflow requirements, configuring self-hosted runners is a necessary option. Self-hosted runners allow you to leverage your own infrastructure, providing the performance, security, and customization needed to execute your jobs effectively.

For more information on setting up self-hosted runners, you can refer to the [official GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).
